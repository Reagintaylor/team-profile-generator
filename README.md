# team-profile-generator

## Description
- The team profile generator is an app that helps you generate an html file outlining the employees you have with specific details for each. 

- I enjoyed creating this application. One of the new features I learned to implement were the tests. For the test, I used the npm package jest. 

- Some other technologies used in this project were Node, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and npm packages like, fs(file system), and inquirer.
